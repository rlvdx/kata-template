# ðŸ‘‹ Hi.

### PHP version
I'm currently working, by default, with `PHP 5.6`.

### Packages
I come with this required via Composer:
- `beberlei/assert`
- `fzaninotto/faker`
- `mockery/mockery`
- `phpunit/phpunit`
- `symfony/var-dumper`

### Make commands
My recipes work, by default, on PHP 5.6 with a docker runtime.

Run `make help` to know:
- how to change my `make` runtime behaviour (no docker, version, etc.)
- get my available recipes
